Project Flow

- Download the dataset.
- Preprocess or clean the data.
- Analyze the pre-processed data.
- Train the machine with preprocessed data using an appropriate machine learning algorithm.
- Save the model and its dependencies.
- Build a Web application using a flask that integrates with the model built.

# ----------------------------

- As the dataset which we are using is a Classification dataset  we can use any of the following algorithms,

Logistic Regression
Random Forest Regression / Classification
Decision Tree Regression / Classification
K-Nearest Neighbors
Support Vector Machine

- Random Forest Classifier - highest accuracy
